            <h1>Jawon's Opinion With Love At First Sight.</h1>
            <p>Love comes and goes, whether it's a significant other, or it can be an inanimate object. But There are others who think that they can find love at first sight. This video will show an example. </p>

            <p>Explanation: I used cars in this Animation, due to the fact that I am a car enthusiast. BMW and Mercedes are my two favorite models. These are the car brands I used to represent how exterior beauty can gain the attention of another. This is what is described as Love at first sight. </p>
